# SRAM

# Abstract
SRAM is a memory issue and is utilized in diverse VLSI chips because of its specific functionality to keep data. This memory cell has end up a topic of studies to satisfy the needs for destiny conversation systems.  In this  paper a  6T SRAM mobileular  is designed  via way of means of using  cadence virtuoso  EDA  device in  180nm CMOS technology. Its  overall performance traits such as  energy  dissipation,  postpone, and  energy  postpone product  are analysed. Power dissipation, postpone, and energy postpone made from the designed 6T SRAM cell


# INTRODUCTION
Static random access memory  (SRAM)  is a  static memory cell that is widely  used in various digital systems. It is quicker and consumes much less strength compared to different memory cells. It does now no longer require freshness periodically. Because of this, SRAM is the maximum famous reminiscence cell amongst VLSI designers. Hence non-stop evolution goes on for higher overall performance of SRAM cells. Due to this, distinct sorts of SRAM cells are to be had withinside the literature like 6T SRAM cell, 7T SRAM cell, 8T SRAM cell, 9T SRAM cell etc. Most, not unusual place SRAM cells utilized in the virtual gadget is the 6T SRAM cell. This cell can save a 1-little bit of data. The bit stays withinside the cell  as long as strength is supplied.  In this paper, design  and overall performance evaluation of a 6T SRAM cell  is discussed.  Performance evaluation is carried out by using  Cadence Virtuoso in  180nm  CMOS technology.

# 6T Bit-cell
6T Bit-cell is a usually used industrial well-known bit cell in SRAM cache memory layout. In order to very well apprehend the format layout of the 6T Bit-cell, it's far encouraged to recognize the examine and write operations of the 6T Bit-cell. With previous expertise of examine-write operations, you can still determine the widths of the 6 transistors withinside the 6T Bit-cell the smallest bit cell unit, which contributes to the full SRAM memory location at the chip. the 6T Bit-cell.
